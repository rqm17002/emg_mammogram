EMG DATA FILES - MAMMOGRAM PADDLE PROCEDURE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This repo contains files for 25 subjects as they completed two sequential 4-compression mammogram protocols (along with 3 controls)
For each subject, there are 11 files, each corresponding to the 8 compressions and 3 controls

  PXX indicated the subject number
  C1 - control 1 in a large room without mammo machine
  C2 - control 2 in the small room with the mammo machine, prior to any compressions
  C3 - control 3 in the small room with the mammo machine, after the first 4 compressions, before the second set of 4 compressions
  FP1 - compression with the flat paddle - LMO
  FP2 - compression with the flat paddle - RMO
  FP3 - compression with the flat paddle - RMLO
  FP4 - compression with the flat paddle - LMLO
  CP1 - compression with the curved paddle - LMO
  CP2 - compression with the curved paddle - RMO
  CP3 - compression with the curved paddle - RMLO
  CP4 - compression with the curved paddle - LMLO

The .csv is the raw output from the data acquisition software for all of the muscles of interest (labels in row63). Note different fs for specfic sensors.
